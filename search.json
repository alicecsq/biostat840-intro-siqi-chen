A gathering is more fun with board games, in addition to food and chatting. Here, I would like to figure out which game, from different categories (taking into considerations of personalities etc), is the most suited for hanging out with friends depending on party size, and ratings. Assuming that we’re all above 21 years old.\nQuestions to be answered: 1) Is there a relationship between max players and playing times across board games; 2) What are the top3 most highly rated (average) games for each of the top10 highly rated (average) game categories?\n\n\n\nFor anyone, especially those above 21 years old, who is considering buying board games for gathering or parties.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\n#library(here)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n#library(\"maps\")\n\n# saves data only once (not each time you knit a R Markdown)\nif(!file.exists(\"board_games.RDS\")) {\n  url_csv <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-03-12/board_games.csv'\n  board_games <- readr::read_csv(url_csv)\n  \n  # save the file to RDS objects\n  saveRDS(board_games, file= \"board_games.RDS\")\n}\n\n\n\nHere are some of the libraries I used in this analysis.\n\nboard_games <- readRDS(\"board_games.RDS\")\nas_tibble(board_games)\n\n# A tibble: 10,532 × 22\n   game_id descrip…¹ image max_p…² max_p…³ min_age min_p…⁴ min_p…⁵ name  playi…⁶\n     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1       1 Die Mach… //cf…       5     240      14       3     240 Die …     240\n 2       2 Dragonma… //cf…       4      30      12       3      30 Drag…      30\n 3       3 Part of … //cf…       4      60      10       2      30 Samu…      60\n 4       4 When you… //cf…       4      60      12       2      60 Tal …      60\n 5       5 In Acqui… //cf…       6      90      12       3      90 Acqu…      90\n 6       6 In the a… //cf…       6     240      12       2     240 Mare…     240\n 7       7 In Cathe… //cf…       2      20       8       2      20 Cath…      20\n 8       8 In this … //cf…       5     120      12       2     120 Lord…     120\n 9       9 Although… //cf…       4      90      13       2      90 El C…      90\n10      10 Elfenlan… //cf…       6      60      10       2      60 Elfe…      60\n# … with 10,522 more rows, 12 more variables: thumbnail <chr>,\n#   year_published <dbl>, artist <chr>, category <chr>, compilation <chr>,\n#   designer <chr>, expansion <chr>, family <chr>, mechanic <chr>,\n#   publisher <chr>, average_rating <dbl>, users_rated <dbl>, and abbreviated\n#   variable names ¹​description, ²​max_players, ³​max_playtime, ⁴​min_players,\n#   ⁵​min_playtime, ⁶​playing_time\n\n\nThe data used in this analysis comes from TidyTuesday.
