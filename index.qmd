Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Siqi Chen (Alice). I am a 3rd year [Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology](https://bcmb.bs.jhmi.edu) PhD student at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Here's a photo of jellyfish I took at the National Aquarium in late October 2022. I am amazed by their incredible nervous system.
